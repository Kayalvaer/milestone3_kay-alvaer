## USER STORIES

_**As an employee I want:**_

1. - As a user, I want to virtually understand the main purpose of the site and understand the aim of the company services.

- **TEST**: When the site is opened, the home page presents a carousel slide with images related to the services the site hopes to achieve. The search part in the home page also gives the user an idea of the kind of projects we work with. For future development i will restrict the kind of information that can be displayed to a non-user. The current information is safe for an inhouse platform.

6. - As a user, I want to see a list of epics and relevant details for epics so that i know what projets are not completed yet.

- **TEST**: As mention before, projects or epics in an agile team are put forward to the team to make decisions on deadlines and who will take what task.That means that all epics and stories must be transparent when released by the product manager and user stories will help to create the tasks and deadlines.
