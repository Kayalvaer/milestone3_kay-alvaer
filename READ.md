## Code Institute: Milestone Project 3

![Project Mock-up](static/css/images/usermanager.png)

This project goal is to give employees of any organisation or a department in a company a core working space where they can share write and display their Epics or projects. This aims to allow employees to register themselves and create the project details , following the agile process of creating stories and epics and having a Scrum master and Project owner to manage the overall inputs. The system satisfies the CRUD functionality process. 

For future development i will restrict the kind of information that can be displayed to a non-user. The current information is safe for an inhouse platform, the system makes the other collaborating teams in a common organisation to be aware of the projects a certain department is working on.These helps also for better collaboration and they will know who to contact incase of related queries.

This project is the third one, out of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program I am attending at The Code Institute. 

**Disclaimer:** The usermanager app is developed for educational purposes only.

<h1>1. Design Process (UX)</h1>

<span id="1.1-userstories"></span>

## 1.1 User stories

_**Site users**_

**As an employee I want:**

- As a user, I want to virtually understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
- As a user, I want to easily sign up to the website.
- As a user, I want to easily Sign in on the site on all pages.
- As a user, I want to be able to and and write epics and user stories after a retrospective, so that if one team member is not available the work can be done.
- As a user, I want to view a list of epics and be able to edit or mark them done as per our teamÂ´s agreement of finished projects.
- As a user, I want to see a list of epics and relevant details for epics so that i know what projets are not completed yet.
- As a user, I want to update or delete lists as per the team morals.

_**Developer**_

<span id="1.2-strategy"></span>

## 1. Strategy

- Provide a platform where the user can add epics.
- Provide a platform where the CRUD functionality if fulfilled to meet employee expectations.
- Provide a platform where user can see and share new and existing epics.
- Provide a platform which interacts with the users and alerts them, so that their can be aware of their actions.
- Create an enjoyable, and easy to use platform that makes the user enjoy using it frequently.


<span id="1.2-scope"></span>


## 2. Project scope

The idea of this project was inspired of my experience of being an intern in Technical team of an organisation and it was frunstrating, at that time that some of the solutions i knew can easily be solved by technology and my IT skills as a student at that time were limited. I enjoyed it would like to explore other functionalities for expansion. Am thankful to the team and the product manager of the organisation for the inspiration and skills acquired.



- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB and will use my Sass skills for the styling to develop it further.
- Allow the user to sign up into the website with "Register" Button for new users.
- Allow the user to log in into the website.
- Allow the user to create, read, update and delete the epic categories.
- Allow the user to create, read, update, delete and share the epics.


<span id="#1.4-structure"></span>

## Structure Plan

Simplicity was the aim here, due to timeline. Four navigation list items were added, which were: "Logo Name" and buttons to redirect the user to othe pages on the site.

- Every page has the same structure to keep consistency and to make the navigation easy to assimilate.
- The Colour themes are consistant as well on all pages.



<span id="#1.5-skeleton"></span>

## 4. UX/UI Choices

### Colors:
- #### Colour scheme
  The colours that are used for the start and game over screen are:
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fffff/000000?text=+) #fffff (white)
- ![#fafafa](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fafafa/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#009688](https://via.placeholder.com/15/009688/000000?text=+) #009688 (teal)
- ![#ff5722](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff5722/000000?text=+) #ff5722 (orange)
- ![#e29584](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e29584/000000?text=+) #e29584 (light orange)
- ![#bf360c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/bf360c/000000?text=+) #e29584 (dark orange)

[Portfolio website](assets/imgs/figma-color palette.png)

The color choice of this project was putting into consideration the professionalism of the project that can is soft with a blue/greenish and light orange color and vibrant to with the darker version of the bootstrap materialise design orange warning color. The white and dark colors were also added to neutralize the ui tone.

- #### Typography :

"Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) has been used in the website. It was clear and looked good on the site, with an italic on the logo.

- #### Images:
Some images were used in the website and resized using [tinypng site](https://tinypng.com/) and all of them have a common background gradient of #ffffff and #e29584 colours, as a base colour and gives a different tone to the body.


#### Wireframes:

- Database Diagram to show the interaction anf functionality view of the pages.
![Mindmap Diagram](static/css/images/mindmap.png)

- Paper wireframes and Mockup on figma was designed for the project. Most of the work was done on paper because of the strategic placing of the board nodes which were challenging.The mockups were designed with
1. Initial design 
[Wireframes Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2SsTNHq5U1y25Qgbd8aAnR/The-Systems-Space?node-id=0%3A1) 
2. Changed most of the layout to a new design 
[Wireframes Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lKQZBpKQDntcB0VcKEZgw2/Untitled?node-id=0%3A3)


- Navigation bar - Menu with links pointing to each page
  - **Home** -  A picture carousel with images that let the user know the collaboration aims of the website and have a visual feel of what it is about.
  - **Sign Up / Sign In** - Which are visible to unregistered users to give them the option to register or for registered ones to sign in. Available on all pages and on the carousel as a button to keep consistency and user friendliness.
  - **Employee Profile** - After users sign up and login, they are redirected to their profile with a flash message welcoming them.
  - **Epics** - A page were the total list of all epics are displayed. here the users can click done button which will delete the epic or edit the epic. The list is open to all employees however managed by admin to trasfer them to other roadmapping matrixes. The epics are open to all employees because the aim is for transparency and core working space. 
  - **Manage Epics** - Only visible to Product owner and Scrum master. This page gives the product owner and scrum master the posibility to see the epics all in a different format for easy transfer into delivery charts and other processes. They can edit and delete the epics as well. 
  and delete it.

## Testing

Most of the testing was done throughout the development and errors fixed as I coded normal errors that cannot be resolved because of jinja were there but my mentor said it is normal. some of them included in the stackflow fields mentined below. the heroku URL was then tested on:
 - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)  and the results were as follows:


- [Closing Tag Checker for HTML5](https://www.aliciaramirez.com/closing-tags-checker/) - Validates that all tags are opening and closing correctly.

## Project barriers and solutions
- In the employee page I had added a form in the edit modal to allow employees or users to add more details about themselves like
images, birthdate to achieve a more personalised introduction of employees to others. 
The modal failed to load and post data to heroku. The basic user registration field was left as basic as possible
and there expansion of the input fields in the sign-in can be a future expansion projects with more time needed.
- The epic lists gaveme issues to open because of the naming of the targeted data, and i contacted tutor support
for assistance which actually required me to use both the function and the id name and data-targets when calling the function (From line 60 on epic.html page)
